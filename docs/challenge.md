# The Frontend Tech Challenge

Thanks for taking the time to do our tech challenge. The challenge requires you
to build a small content creation tool that can help you edit selected images
and download them.

For this challenge, you should use the free image gallery API Lorem Pictus.
Please find the detailed documentation of the API at <https://picsum.photos/>.
The application should satisfy these user stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to browse through the list of images.
  - Images list should be paginated.
  - Image items should include image preview and author's name.
- As a user, I want to click an image and be navigated to the edit image page.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit the image, i.e. be able to:
  - select the image size [height, width]
  - choose the greyscale mode.
  - blur the image (grade between 1 - 10)
  - see the currently edited image preview
- As a user, I want to be able to refresh the page at any point and still get
the previous result
- As a user I want the page to remember where I was when going back in history

## Getting started

We don't have any requirements on what stack you use to solve the task, so there is nothing
set up beforehand.

## Timing

We're not looking for perfection, rather try to show us something special and have reasons
for your decisions. Get back to us when you have a timeline for when you are done.

## Where to send the results

Please share a link to the private repository that contains your solution. And, of course, let us
know, if you run into any problems.

## Notes

This is technically possible to implement only on the front end.
> Please focus more on code quality, building a robust solution and such, than on the UI.
As part of a debrief, be able to present the solution.
